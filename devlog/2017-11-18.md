Working more on the event/battle system, fixed a camera bug earlier this week where the event scene wouldn't be positioned
where the viewport was.

Currently defining event data as json so I'm able to import what I need and keep it nice and manageable.

Set up code around saving as well as a title screen menu code with controls to select continue or new game. At this point I need
to set up the load game functionality.
