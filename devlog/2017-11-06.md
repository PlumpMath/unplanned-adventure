Working on scene changing and warping between maps while maintaining the last overworld position.

Need to figure out how to sanely persist last overworld position. I'm probably storing it at the wrong point.
Also need to consider the prospect of maps that have multiple entrances.

Added title screen place holder and quick and dirty warping system. The same method used to warp also loads the overworld so it
can all live by the same rules. The warp dictionary inside the map is a good foundation for other things that will be present on
maps in the future such as NPCs, specific event tiles, interactables, pickups, etc.

Definitely have a good base to move forward with now for map related stuff.
