Spent the evening working on the mapManager, hoping it will make working with loading maps and managing data a lot easier
& let me abstract some concepts like exiting a map without explicitly saying where it needs to go.

The rough idea behind the mapManager is that it recieves a generic dictionary of what the warp type is, the position on the map it was accessed from,
and where it's target is (in the case of it being a standard WARP).

This introduces the concept of map WARP types:

WARP => going forward but maintaining a history in so you can go back, like if you were traversing floors of a dungeon
BACK_WARP => uses the map history array, allowing a warp tile to be designated to just go back, popping the current map off the stack and fetching the last one.
EXIT_WARP => breaks the chain completely, clearing out any maps stored in history and replaces it with the current map starting history over again.

The idea isn't 100% but I think it is definitely a step in the right direction to handle things like where a player should spawn if they exit the map from a specific
direction.
