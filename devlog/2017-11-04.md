Decided to regroup my thoughts on the map, backing out of using Tiled before going in too deep and getting stuck.
Additionally, after I had introduced it it seemed to crash my editor a lot :C May be related to the binary scene format.

Currently using a tilemap from [opengameart.org](https://opengameart.org/content/zelda-like-tilesets-and-sprites) as a placeholder
and possible template to get stuff moving. At least to prototype out different parts of the map.

Now implementing tileset directly through Godot. May be able to make best of both worlds and build a tileset importer from Tiled, at a later date.
Had an epiphany as to how to expand upon the grid movement system's vacancy check to check rather for passability so I can look at the tilemap first
and then if any objects are stored in the grid.

The system is now setup where the map scene is loaded in by the main Grid scene, the loaded child map scene provides it all the information about itself
such as dimensions, passable and encounter tiles, and grid size.
