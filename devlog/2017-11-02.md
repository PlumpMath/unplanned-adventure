Did some more planning today, mostly on how the world of the game will be built and a couple of concepts around
random events.

Reading up on working with TileMap nodes in Godot. Also learning more about working with the camera, I wasn't 100% on scene transitions.
GDQuest has been a wonderful resource for all of this.

Investigating more into restrictions of the Game Boy Color; 56 colors on screen max, sprites had 4 colors (transparent + 3).
This will be fun to work with restrictions that let me make the game look like how I remember the RPGs of my youth like
Dragon Warrior Monsters & Pokemon.

Imported Tiled plugin to use Tiled maps later on.
