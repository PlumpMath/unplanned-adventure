Have been working on fixing a bug I introduced with the new map warping code where it will delete the warp data on player spawn.

-- Update --
Fixed that issue by keeping track of warp tiles separately. I have a different issue now of needing to stop momentum. I may cheat
by making every town a "walled town" so there is only one entrance...
