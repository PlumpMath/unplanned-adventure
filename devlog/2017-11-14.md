Fixed issue regarding warping in from sides, except top >.<, expanded the grid size to have one row off screen where the
exit warp tiles live. So now when you leave the map, you actually leave.

Working on eventing now, going for an NES Dragon Quest style where boxes are drawn over the map rather than rendering in
a different screen. It kind of helps with the throwback aesthetic.

Patch9Frame is pretty slick.
