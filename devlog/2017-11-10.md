Spent some time working on programmer art tiles to replace the ones borrowed from opengameart.org.

Some slight realizations about my approach to managing tile collision data, may need to reverse it again
and just track tiles you can pass through. There are more tiles you can't walk on due to the higher number
of unqiue tiles used to make more aesthetic maps. I am referencing Pokemon though, trying to keep stuff simple.

This is far from ideal :|
```gdscript
const IMPASSABLE = [
	WATER,
	BUSH,
	COAST0,
	COAST1,
	COAST2,
	COAST3,
	COAST4,
	COAST5,
	COAST6,
	COAST7,
	COAST8,
	COAST9,
	COASTA,
	COASTB
	]
```

Making a revision to the mapManager, realized I don't need to track history because ultimately when I setup something like
a map where the exit is a newly undefined area, I won't know where to spawn the player. Now map data will include the enter
and exit coordinates. This will require some additional work to let that override the default spawn coordinates. I also want
to stop momentum on passing through the warp tile, and spawn player on what is essentially another warp tile without triggering
it. Definitely going to require managing the player state of movement.
