Final day. Did a lot of sprite work. Drew up dungeon floors. Made new monsters and an "end game".

Happy with how this turned out even if it's pretty much a prototype of an RPG. This was my first
real project in Godot and I think it went really well. I'm sure there is a lot of room for improvement
not counting the lack of any real game feel.

Going to write up the itch.io page and make builds tomorrow.
