Time has been spent revisiting almost everything about warping between maps, and map data management.
I've decided to go back to something I had implemented early on and fetch the tile name that is stored witin
the tileset itself. It was a hell of a lot easier because I had already set it once there rather than having
to redefine it once again for what amounts to no reason.

Spawn data will come from the globally stored map object, the idea is that info will be determined based on the tile they warped to.

Still need to fix the result of where you spawn based on the linked warp tile.
