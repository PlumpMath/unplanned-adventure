Last week of the jam, I've got a lot more work to do than I thought :| Time to make some cuts.

I am finishing up combat, even if I have to sacrifice the idea of an inventory system. This will
probably require working around how you heal. Probably will have to heal between fights by default, consider
it stamina and not health?
