Spent evening doing some planning, sketching out some rough ideas for screens.

Current concept is for a throwback to older JRPGs, an aesthetic similar to those on the Game Boy / Game Boy Color.

Movement will be grid based, random encounters will fuel everything from engaging monsters to getting quests.
Combat will be turn based, drawing inspiration from games like Final Fantasy and Pokemon.
An additional core component of the game is the weighted randomness applied to it, attempting to make things a bit
more fun during each play through.

The first dev goal is to get a grid and tile map setup, including character movement.
