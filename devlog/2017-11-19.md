Working on monster & player data since it's going to be integral for the whole combat portion of the event system
and I needed something to feed into the random encounters.

Monsters and the player will function based off the same rules in regards to stats:

``` json
// Example monster data
"slime": {
    "armor": 0, // Reduces damage received if defense is not successful
    "atk": 1,  // Modifier for attack phase
    "base": 0, // Base modifier used in all formulas
    "exp": 1, // Modifier for experience received
    "def": 1, // Modifier for defense phase
    "hp": 5 // Modifier for hit points,
    "run": 1 // Percentage the player will be able to flee
}
```

Combat and post-combat are goverened by basic formulae.

Combat attack and defense rolls are based off of `base + (level * modifier)`
This number yields the number of "six sided dice" (it simplifies the concept) rolled from the die pool.
Only one "success" is needed to hit/defend. 1-3 is a failure, 4-6 is success.
On success, `damage` is dealt in the form of the number of successful dice rolled.
Getting a 6 is a critical success and for the attacking entity, it adds another die roll for every critical success.
Only base rolls can add additional rolls. This restricts the number of damage dealt to at best be double the base possible.

A similar roll is used for defense, with the exception of `successful rolls + armor` reduce the incoming damage. Think of it more as a
dodge or how well the defender got out of the way or took a glancing blow.

Experience gained is based off of `abs(player.level - monster.level) + (10 * monster.exp)`
For the player, experience scale is `last_exp_target + (last_exp_target * 10%)`, starting with 100 exp at level 1.

The ability to flee from combat is determined by the `run` value on the monster, think of it like an aggression. Weaker monsters provide you
a higher rate of success to flee. A failure to flee takes place of an attack or defense roll, so it should be used wisely.

Overall, random encounters have a 25% chance of occurring, and what is encountered is based on the encounter data provided by the map.
